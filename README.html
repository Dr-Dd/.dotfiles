<h1>drd&rsquo;s dotfiles</h1>

<p>Small dotfiles collection for quickly bootstrapping a fresh arch install.
To install all the needed packages run <code>install-all.sh</code>, i&rsquo;ve included some comments in the install script (i suggest you to take a look at them).</p>

<p>To symlink all the needed config files use stow: i&rsquo;ve divided stow-able config files in home <code>(~)</code> files and root <code>(/)</code> files.</p>

<ul>
<li>All root files are marked with the prefix <code>root-</code>, and need to be stowed with a different target (and as root). So, to install them all, just run</li>
<li><code>sudo stow -t / root-*</code></li>
<li>Home files are marked with the prefix <code>home-</code> so, just as before, to stow them all run (make sure to run stow from the repo dir)</li>
<li><code>stow home-*</code></li>
</ul>


<p>If you find any conflicts, consider deleting the already existing files or just adopting them. Remember that these dotfiles satisfy MY preferences.</p>

<p>NOTE: There seems to usually be a problem in symlinking system files, so, until futher testing is done, root files are unusable</p>
